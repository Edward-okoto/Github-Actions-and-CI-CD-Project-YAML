### Workflow syntax and structure

**Objectives**
- Understand YAML syntax for workflows
- Learn the structure and components of a workflow.

1.YAML syntax for Workflow

- Yaml is a human-readable data serialization standard used for configuration files.
- Key concepts-Indentation,key-value pair,list.

Example snippet.

    name: CI Workflow

    on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main



2.Workflow Structure and Components.

- Workflow File: Located in ` .github/workflow ` directory .Eg `main.yml`
- Jobs : Define task like building,testing and deploying
- Steps : Individual task within a job
- Actions : Reusable units of code within steps
- Events : Triggers for the workflow eg push,pull_request.
- Runners : The servers where the job runs eg ubuntu-latest.


### Implementing Continuous Integration.

Lesson 1: Building and Testing Codes

Objectives:
- Set up build step in github actions
- Run test as part of the CI process.

**Setting Up Build Steps**

- In your Github workflow file (eg` .github/workfow/main.yml`),start be defining a `job` named `build`.

- This job is responsible for building your code.

        jobs:
          build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            # Steps will be defined next

**Adding Build Steps**

- Each step in the job performs a specific task.
- Here, we added three steps: Checking out the code, installing dependencies, and running the build script.



```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # 'actions/checkout@v2' is a pre-made action that checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
    # 'npm install' installs the dependencies defined in your project's 'package.json' file.

  - name: Build
    run: npm run build
    # 'npm run build' runs the build script defined in your 'package.json'. This is typically used for compiling or preparing your code for deployment.
```

**Running Test In The Workflow**

1.Adding Test steps
 - After your build steps,include steps to execute your test scripts.
 - This ensures that your code is not only built,but also passes all the test.


```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    # 'actions/checkout@v2' is a pre-made action that checks out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your workflow can access it.

  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm install
    # 'npm install' installs the dependencies defined in your project's 'package.json' file.

  - name: Build
    run: npm run build
    # 'npm run build' runs the build script defined in your 'package.json'. This is typically used for compiling or preparing your code for deployment.

  - name: Run tests
    run: npm test
    # 'npm test' runs the test script defined in your 'package.json'. It's crucial for ensuring that your code works as expected before deployment.
```

#### Additional YAML Concepts In Github ACtions:

Detailed Steps and Code Explanation.

1.Using Environmental variables.

- Environment variables can be defined at the workflow,job or step level.
- They allow you to dynamically pass configurations and settings.

```yaml
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: value
  # Define an environment variable 'CUSTOM_VAR' at the workflow level.

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use environment variable
        run: echo $CUSTOM_VAR
        # Access 'CUSTOM_VAR' in a step.
```

2.Working with secrets

- Secrets are encrypted set in your GITHUB repository settings.
- Ideal for storing sensitive data like access Tokens,passwords,etc.



```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Use secret
        run: |
          echo "Access Token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
          # Use 'ACCESS_TOKEN' secret defined in the repository settings.
```

3.Conditional Execution

You can control when jobs, steps or workflow run based on conditions.


```yaml
jobs:
  conditional-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    # The job runs only for push events to the 'main' branch.
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
```

3.Using Output and Input between steps

Share data between steps in a job using output.



```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - id: step-one
        run: echo "::set-output name=value::$(echo hello)"
        # Set an output named 'value' in 'step-one'.
      
      - id: step-two
        run: |
          echo "Received value from previous step: ${{ steps.step-one.outputs.value }}"
          # Access the output of 'step-one' in 'step-two'.
```
4.Configure Build Matrices

A **build matrix** allows you to test your application across a combination of operating systems, language versions, or any other variables.

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12, 14, 16] # Test across Node.js versions
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest] # Test across OS
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        # Checkout your code

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        # Set up the Node.js version defined in the matrix

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
        # Install project dependencies

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        # Run tests across all matrix combinations
```

This matrix setup will run tests across multiple Node.js versions (`12`, `14`, `16`) and operating systems (`Ubuntu`, `Windows`, and `macOS`).

5.Implement Parallel and Matrix Build

Parallelization is automatically handled when you use matrix strategiesâ€”each combination defined in the matrix runs in parallel, significantly reducing build times.


```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Build and Test
        run: echo "Running build and tests"

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to staging
        run: echo "Deploying to staging environment"
```


6.Manage Dependencies Across Different Environments
To manage environment-specific dependencies, you can use conditionals or environment variables:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        env: [development, staging, production] # Define environments
    steps:
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          if [ "${{ matrix.env }}" == "production" ]; then
            npm install --only=prod
          else
            npm install
          fi
        # Install production-only dependencies for the 'production' environment
```

7. Integrate Code Quality Checks

   Objectives:

   a)  Integrate code analysis tools into the GitHub Action workflow.
   b)  Configure linters and static code analyzers for    maintaining code quality


```yaml
name: CI Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

env:
  NODE_ENV: development

jobs:
  code-quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 16

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run Linter
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
        # Ensures that code follows style guidelines set in ESLint.

      # Step 5: Static Code Analysis
      - name: Run Static Code Analysis
        run: npx eslint . --max-warnings=0
        # Enforces zero warnings and performs static analysis.

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [code-quality]
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 3: Build the project
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build]
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 3: Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [build, test]
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Step 2: Use secrets (example for deployment token)
      - name: Deploy
        run: echo "Deploying with token: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_TOKEN }}"
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **`code-quality` Job**:
   - Introduced a new job for running code quality checks using ESLint for linting and static code analysis.
   - Ensures that only high-quality code is passed down to the build and test phases.

2. **Dependencies Between Jobs**:
   - The `build` job depends on the successful completion of the `code-quality` job using `needs: [code-quality]`.
   - The `test` job depends on `build`, maintaining a logical flow.

3. **Zero-Warning Enforcement**:
   - The `npx eslint . --max-warnings=0` command ensures the workflow fails if any warnings are present, enforcing stricter quality checks.

4. **Full CI/CD Workflow**:
   - Combines code quality, build, testing, and deployment into a seamless pipeline.

This structure ensures that only linted, analyzed, built, and tested code progresses to deployment, improving reliability and maintainability.
